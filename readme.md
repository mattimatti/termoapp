# Cordova Backbone Template (v0.3.2)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/holidayextras/cordova-backbone-template.png)](https://travis-ci.org/holidayextras/cordova-backbone-template)

## What is it?

This goal of this repository is to jump start you past all the complexity of setting up a Cordova app and project workflow. You should be able to download, compile and run the project on iOS or Android in a few commands, and easily get developing and making changes using JavasScript and Backbone.js straight away.

We've chosen Backbone for this template project as it's **1.** simple, **2.** well documented, **3.** widely used and **4.** not too heavily prescribed in terms of application architecture/best practices. It's also what I'm most familiar with...

As it comes, this project also uses Coffeescript (which is auto-converted to JS by a grunt task) because we feel it's nicer to write object-oriented web applications in. If you don't want to use it, see the section below on removing it.

## Installation/Running

### Other Dependencies
 * For iOS releases, [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), and the Xcode Command Line Tools (Google for loads instructions on installing these)
 * For Android releases, [The Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
 * [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/)
 
With these, you should be able to run the following commands to get the included sample project up and running.

### Running on a device or simulator

Installing node/bower dependencies (both locally and globally for node):

```
npm install -g
npm install 
bower install
```

Getting your app ready for compilation:

```
grunt build
```

Running your tests:

```
grunt test
```

Adding your ios or android platforms:

```
cordova platforms add ios
cordova platforms add android
```

Building your application for ios or android:

```
cordova build ios
cordova build android
```

Running your app in an ios or android simulator:

``` 
cordova emulate ios
cordova emulate android
```

Running your app on a physical device:

```
cordova run ios
cordova run android
```

## Working on your application

### Automating your workflow with grunt tasks

When making an application from this template, you'll largely be editing source in the `assets` folder, which will then be automatically compiled/converted into relevant JavaScript and CSS for running. In order to automate this process and streamline your workflow, there are some helpful grunt tasks included:

```
grunt watch
```
This will watch the assets folder for code changes, and convert/copy your coffeescript, less and images on the fly.

```
grunt server
```
Runs a HTTP server on port 5000 to server up what's in your `www` folder. You can run your app in-browser at `http://localhost:5000`, or run your tests at `http://localhost:5000/js/spec`.

With these two tasks running, code changes you make in `assets` are ready to view in a matter of seconds, meaning you don't have to manually re-compile or re-deploy to a device to view your work.

### Running your tests

The default template includes a couple of very basic Mocha/Chai/Sinon tests to get you going, you'll find these in `assets/javascripts/spec`, and they can be run with the `grunt test` command. When adding new test files, be sure to include them in `assets/javascripts/spec/app_spec.coffee` or they will not be run. 

Your tests are converted from coffeescript to javascript the same way your application code is, so be sure to keep your `grunt watch` task running while working on them, or run `grunt build` before you run them each time to see changes. 

With `grunt server` running, you can also access your tests at `http://localhost:5000/js/spec`.

### Technologies/Libraries used in the vanilla template

 * Coffeescript
 * Less
 * RequireJs
 * Backbone
 * JQuery
 * Underscore
 * HammerJS
 * Mocha
 * Chai
 * Sinon

### Adding new libraries

You can add new libraries and modules to use in your project via `bower` or `node`. E.g:

```
bower install my-desired-module --save
npm install my-desired-module --save
```

Use `bower` for libraries and modules you want to be available in your application, these are installed into the `components` directory. Use `node` for ones you want as part of your development workflow (this includes running tests), these are installed into the `node_modules` directory.

For any bower components you want to use in your project, you'll need to configure them for use with requirejs, to do this. Add them to your `assets/javascripts/app/require_config.coffee` file. If you're struggling with this, [read up on how requirejs works](http://requirejs.org/).


## Working without Coffeescript

If you don't want to use coffeescript, you can replace the `coffee` task in your project's `Gruntfile.coffee` with a `copy` task to copy across your .js files instead.

For more info, see the [grunt-contrib-copy](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-copy) project, or copy and modify an existing `copy` task from this project's gruntfile.
